# Project Overview

## Task 1: Custom YouTube Result Template
Got the main part of the task done, but with a few complications :

- **Badges Functionality**: Couldn't implement as intended. Attempted to add "Top Result" and "Featured" badges but faced issues.
  
- **Field Retrievals**: Encountered difficulties retrieving certain fields directly (e.g., thumbnail, video duration). Used placeholders (e.g., cute dog image for thumbnails, static number for duration) to progress. The hyperlink functionality works as expected.

## Task 2: Filter for 2022 Content
Successfully implemented after a detailed review of the Headless documentation. :) 

## Conclusion

While not all features were fully implemented, the project provided valuable insights into working with Coveo's Headless framework and emphasized the critical role of documentation in overcoming technical challenges.
